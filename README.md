# slackbuilds

This repository contains my **SlackBuilds** scripts for the **Slackware Linux** distribution.

It provides:

- SlackBuild scripts used to compile packages
- Application source code
- Binary packages generated from the builds

The scripts follow Slackware’s philosophy and standards, allowing local package compilation from source, ensuring greater control, transparency, and system compatibility.
